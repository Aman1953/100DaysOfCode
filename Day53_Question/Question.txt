Problem statement
The numerological reduction of a number is the sum of digits calculated recursively until the resulting value is a single digit.
You are given a function,
int FindNumerologicalReduction(int n);
The function accepts a positive integer ‘n’. Implement the function to find and return the numerological reduction of ‘n’.
Assumption
n > 0
Example
Input
3245
Output
5
Explanation
3245 = 3 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 14
14 = 1 + 4 = 5
Hence 5 is the numerological reduction of 3245
Input format
Contains a single integer
Output format
The Sum of digits reduced up to single-digit
